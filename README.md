## Project Brief: To-Do List API with Java Spring Boot, MongoDB, and MapStruct

# 1. Short Description
You will build a To-Do List API using Spring Boot, MongoDB as the database, and MapStruct to map entities to DTOs. This API will have CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features for managing task lists.

# 2. Key Features
Add tasks with complete attributes.
Retrieve all tasks or filter them (e.g., by status: completed/pending).
Update tasks (modify description, status, or deadline).
Delete tasks from the list.
3. Data Model & MongoDB Relationships
MongoDB is NoSQL, so data will be stored in collections instead of tables. You will have two main collections:

# Collection 1: tasks (Task List)
Used to store task information.

# | Field	           | Data Type	         | Description
| ------------------ |: ------------------:| ----------------------------------------------------: |
| _id	               | ObjectId	           | Unique task ID (automatically generated by MongoDB).  |
| title	             | String	             | Task title.                                           |
| description	       | String	             | Task description.                                     |
| status	           | String	             | Task status (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED).        |
| priority	         | String	             | Priority (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).                         |
| dueDate	           | LocalDateTime	     | Task due date.                                        |
| createdAt	         | LocalDateTime	     | Task creation timestamp.                              |
| updatedAt	         | LocalDateTime	     | Last update timestamp.                                |
| userId	           | ObjectId	           | Reference to the user who created the task.           |


# Relationships
tasks → users (One user can have multiple tasks, but each task belongs to only one user).
Collection 2: users (Users)
Used to store user information.

# | Field	            | Data Type	                 | Description
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------
| _id	              | ObjectId	                   | Unique user ID.                | 
| username	        | String	                     | Username.                      | 
| email	            | String	                     | User email.                    | 
| password	        | String	                     | Hashed password.               | 
| createdAt	        | LocalDateTime	               | Account creation timestamp.    | 

#4. API Endpoints
Here is the list of required endpoints:

```
Task Management (/api/tasks)
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/tasks	Add a new task.
GET	/api/tasks	Retrieve all tasks.
GET	/api/tasks/{id}	Retrieve a specific task by ID.
PUT	/api/tasks/{id}	Update a task by ID.
DELETE	/api/tasks/{id}	Delete a task by ID.
User Management (/api/users)
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/users	Register a new user.
GET	/api/users/{id}	Retrieve user data by ID.
```


# 5. MapStruct Usage
MapStruct will be used to map data from entities to DTOs, preventing direct database data exposure to clients.

DTOs to be used:
```
TaskRequestDto → Data sent from the client to the server when creating or updating a task.
TaskResponseDto → Data returned to the client (excluding technical details like MongoDB ObjectId).
UserDto → To return user-related task information.
Example of Data Manipulation in Mapper:
Convert MongoDB ObjectId to String before returning data.
Format dueDate as yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm before sending it to the frontend.
Return task status in lowercase ("completed" instead of "COMPLETED").
```

# 6. Technologies Used
Spring Boot (Main framework)
Spring Data MongoDB (Integration with MongoDB)
MapStruct (Mapper for DTOs)
Spring Web (To build REST API)
Spring Validation (For input validation)
